## Schedule

### Day 1

* #### Established project subject and dividing in stages
    * Entities and Hibernate configuration
    * Repositories
    * Populating database
    * Making offers, tests and user console interface
* #### Working on entities
    * Tables:
        * cars (id primary key, brand, model, manufacture_year)
        * car_parts_names (id primary key, name)
        * car_parts (id primary key, oe_number, price, stock)
        * clients (id primary key, name, phone_number)
        * offers (id primary key, amount)
    * Relationships:
        * relationship (clients, offers): oneToMany   
          (one client may receive several offers)
        * relationship (offers, car_parts): manyToMany  
          (one offer may contain several car parts AND one car part may be contained in several offers)
        * relationship (car_parts_names, car_parts): oneToMany    
          (one name may be assumed by several car parts)
        * relationship (car_parts, cars): oneToMany bidirectional   
          (one car is composed by a large amount of car parts BUT one car part is only mounted on one car)
